String Comparisons: -
[ string ] : true if string is not null
[ -z string ] : True if string is empty
[ String1 = string2 ] : true both the strings are equal
[ string1 != String2 ] : true if they are not equal
[ -n string ] true if string is not empty (this  is default operation)
[ string > string2 ] ture if string1 sorts after string2
[ string1 < string2 ] true if string1 sorts before string2

str1=Alfha;
str2=Bravo
str3=
[ $str1 = $str2 ]  ===> this is false as both are not equal strings
[ $str1 != $str2 ] ===> This is true 
[ $str3 ] ==> This is false as str3 is null
[ -n $Str1 ] ==> True because str1 is not empty
[ $str1 ] ==> True becuasestr1 is not empty (same as above, -n is default )
[ -z $str3 ] ==> True as str3 is empty

[$str1 < $str2 ] ==> true as Alfha comes before to Bravo when  sorted
[$str1 > $str2 ] ==> false as Alfha comes before to Bravo when  sorted

Arrays in Bash Shell Script:-

An array is a variable containing multiple values may be of same type or of different type.  There is no maximum limit to the size of an array, nor any requirement that member variables be indexed or assigned contiguously. Array index starts with zero.

Declaring an Array and Assigning values:-
---------------------------------------
In bash, array is created automatically when a variable is used in the format like,
name[index]=value
	?name is any name for an array
index could be any number or expression that must evaluate to a number greater than or equal to zero.You can declare an explicit array using :
	declare -a arrayname.
To access an element from an array use curly brackets like ${name[index]}.
See the below shell script:
$ cat prg42.sh
#! /bin/bash
Unix[0]='Debian'
Unix[1]='Red hat'
Unix[2]='Ubuntu'
Unix[3]='Suse'

echo ${Unix[1]}

$./prg42.sh
Red hat


Initializing an array during declaration:
----------------------------------------
Instead of initializing an each element of an array separately, you can declare and initialize an array by specifying the list of elements (separated by white space) with in a curly braces.
Syntax:
declare -a arrayname=(element1 element2 element3)

If the elements has the white space character, enclose it with in a quotes.

Print the Whole Bash Array:-
---------------------------
There are different ways to print the whole elements of the array. If the index number is @ or *, all members of an array are referenced. You can traverse through the array elements and print it, using looping statements in bash.

echo ${Unix[@]}

Referring to the content of a member variable of an array without providing an index number is the same as referring to the content of the first element, the one referenced with index number zero.
Example:-
   echo ${Unix[0]} is same as ${Unix}
